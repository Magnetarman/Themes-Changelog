# Themes-Changelog
### Official repository with the real-time updated Changelog of the Wordpress Thems  I'm working on.

> The repository is used to connect the various Changelog with the display buttons present in my site http://www.magnetarman.com  So I no longer have to manually update the different pages of themes on wordpress.

**The code of Wordpress Theme that i working on is not pubblic for developer and clients property reasons.**
